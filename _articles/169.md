<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Dear readers, have you ever found yourself intrigued by messages like “Automated Income: Build a system to earn 100 million won immediately without working,” “7-step life hacks to gain complete financial freedom,” or “The absolute law of success that will make you a happy, rich person”? Believe it or not, these flashy lines were featured in ads for some of last year’s best-selling books. Now, let me walk you to another corner of the bookstore.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">“Your forties are not a mistake.” “After reading this book, all your anxiety will disappear.” “You are the most precious thing in this universe.” These, too, are advertisements for some of the most popular books. The fact that such messages are written on the covers of bestsellers probably means that many people actually expect to gain such things promised by reading these books.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">All these books fall under what we call “self-help books,” which underscores how much “self-improvement” has become a buzzword in Korea. Let’s back this up with some data. For instance, let’s dive into Google search trends for the term “self-improvement” from 2010 to 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_BjukVpK7F6EkuWs3POH5JwjyeZQqZLewbSxuPK7spKBtXjBWgkHpJ0tw2RblPV73ETbCE1dPQhdfKDeUut5WmXiHfuxG_VXSRWUW8JmVpy5Nb89vgtXENnCv9KWiuKL_0v2iYg?key=fu0uDFmeytVXq7Hlet-VUV0w" width="369" height="262.66336633663366"></strong></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><i>(purple: South Korea, Yellow: US, Gray: Japan)</i></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">These trends measure interest, with 100 being the peak. Comparing South Korea, the United States, and Japan, the differences are stark. The U.S. stayed steady at around 50, while Japan dropped from 60 to the 40s. South Korea, though? Interest has skyrocketed from below 10 to over 60 in 2023. Temporarily during COVID-19, interest has shot up even higher, reaching levels close to 100. This tells us that while self-improvement started gaining traction later in Korea than in other countries, it’s now a bigger deal here than anywhere else. This rapid growth shows that Korea’s self-help trend is unique and is still on the rise.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">This societal sentiment is reflected in the books we read. The fact that certain books are widely read now is ultimately a response to the desires of the consuming public. Therefore, reading should be examined not just as an individual act but also on a more collective and cultural level. It forms a circular structure where the messages people seek are published, and those messages, in turn, are reinforced within society. That's why discussions about the book market can ultimately be a good lens for looking at Korean society. In other words, as mentioned at the beginning, if self-help books make up a large proportion of current Korean bestsellers, they cannot be considered separate from the intense social interest that Koreans have in self-improvement culture, as shown by the Google search results.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">In fact, the influence of self-help books in the Korean book market is considerable. Let’s look at the data from the Publication Industry Promotion Agency of Korea (KPIPA). Comparing the sales statistics by book genre in the publishing market, books classified as self-help books significantly outperformed other books in terms of sales volume, sales amount, annual growth rate, and unit price between 2022 and 2023. While the sales volume of self-help books grew by 19.08% over a year, other genres saw an average increase of only 3.96%. Sales amount also jumped by 29.61% for self-help books, while other genres saw an increase of&nbsp; 11.08%. Considering the most recent statistics by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism that show an alarmingly low level of reading among Koreans, self-help books seem to be showing exceptional strength. When self-help books occupy the top three spots of Kyobo Bookstore’s annual bestseller list, what more needs to be said about their popularity?</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><i><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeL1HUSfv66e4-ig1SrCuW9dwGuUwhaTtzL_HgyuR-KU2432Q5ybOFe1cR9YE2yxxmSMY7zV0z2u0ED4WwBbzYd7UE7dL9qdwj-3lwYloImQtqUKdlqFmEq-jaHhjfWHE5w-c_txQ?key=fu0uDFmeytVXq7Hlet-VUV0w" width="624" height="187"></i></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><i>translation: Sales volume growth, sales amount growth, other genres VS self-help books, unit: millions</i></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">So, what are these self-help books all about? The concept of “books that help you better who you are ” is perhaps too vague. What exactly makes these books resonate so strongly in Korean society? To answer that, the top 30 bestselling self-help books from Kyobo Bookstore in 2023 were analyzed. While they span different sub-genres, two distinct categories stand out. Let’s call them: “Guidebooks to Get Rich” and “Comforting Letters.” These two types might seem worlds apart, but they both reveal fascinating insights into Korean society. Here’s a breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>Guidebooks to Get Rich</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">First, there are books that are guides on how to make money. These books appear to be for people who hope to become rich. Various methods are given on how to reach this end goal: change your language habits, take notes frequently, create a mindset to think 10 times bigger than before, and so on. The authors typically use the device of ‘rags to riches’ stories, saying that they, too, were once unremarkable, but by trying these methods, were able to quickly accumulate wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">One book highlights the story of a former YouTuber author who says, “Just 10 years ago, he was an ordinary person receiving a monthly salary of 1.6 million won.” Another author, who introduces himself as the CEO of seven corporations and as a YouTuber, confesses that he “lived like a zombie without any thoughts, trapped by these walls: study, money, appearance”; he&nbsp; “was at the bottom of the class at school and a mess in life.” They also draw readers in with storytelling like, “That friend who used to live in a semi-basement, who didn’t stand out in studies or talent, has now become a man with immeasurable wealth.” In this way, all these books that tell stories of people with humble beginnings making a lot of money in a short period of time and passing on tips that can be easily followed have become bestsellers. The promise is that if the author could do it, so can you. Online reviews reveal just how much readers buy into these ideas. Comments like “I love the author’s heart and their willingness to share this life-changing advice” or “I’m planning to reread this book 100 times because it’s that good” show how these books tap into people’s hope and belief in a brighter future. And the methods mentioned are shockingly simple. For example, one book claims, “If you say it out loud a thousand times, your wish will surely come true.” It gives the feeling that just by reading a book, one might be able to manifest a different reality.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>Comforting Letters</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Second, there are books that are like warm letters that comfort readers. The target audience here is “tired people.” Keywords like “fatigue, irritation, anxiety” repeatedly appear in the marketing of these books. The messages they impart seem to deeply touch the members of Korean society who are all living difficult lives in a highly competitive world. For example, there was a best-selling book offering advice to people in their 40s who think it’s too late to start something new or are experiencing a midlife crisis. Another book that collected words from writers, philosophers, and spiritual gurus, emphasizing the importance of enjoying the present, has also gained popularity. In fact, these books don’t offer any concrete solutions. Their main significance lies in understanding and diagnosing the struggles of their readers. And they remind us of things we’ve overlooked while living busy lives in soft and elegant sentences. Though obvious at times, the “wisdom” is often packaged in a unique way using philosophical, abstract, instructive, and even spiritual language. This is how these self-help books sympathize with the inevitably negative emotions experienced by people in modern society and heal wounds. The act of purchasing such warm comfort seems to provide psychological ease to today’s Koreans. Buyer reviews included remarks such as “I gifted it for peace of mind,” and “Reading the prologue that said it’s okay to solve only half of life’s homework, I felt sincerely comforted for the first time in a long while.” In a modern society that demands more effort and achievement, messages like “you don’t have to try that hard” or “you are enough as you are” that cheer people up seem to be exactly what many people want to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>Common Ground: Dissatisfaction with Life</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">At first glance, the simultaneous popularity of these two categories of self-help books seemed to be quite contradictory. One tells you to hustle harder; the other tells you to relax and let go. One uses tough language and goal-oriented narratives, while the other instills one with the courage to be satisfied with the present through the use of abstract and comforting words. But beneath the surface, both categories of self-help exist to capitalize off of the same thing: dissatisfaction with one’s current life. Because people are dissatisfied with their current lives, they either seek easy solutions to obtain a materially abundant lifestyle, or they seek magical sentences that sympathize and understand how difficult they have it. People who buy “Guidebooks to Get Rich” feel their lives would be better if only they had more money. Meanwhile, those drawn to “Comforting Letters” want relief from the stress of trying so hard. Both categories reflect a yearning to escape the struggles of life. The trends of the self-help book market arise from essentially the same perception of reality.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>The Problems with These Books</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Of course, there’s nothing wrong with cultivating various abilities and the mind to become a better self that achieves one’s own goals. However, it’s true that there are concerning points in the recent self-help book trend. Let’s point out why this is problematic.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">First, books that teach how to become rich focus on the goal of self-improvement only in the monetary sense. The fact that many people want this proves how obsessive our society is toward financial success. If these books continue to fuel this collective obsession, it could go as extreme as unhealthy behaviors like money worship. Also, they suggest very simple solutions as if they are really the shortcuts to becoming rich, while most of them are actually rather improbable. People captivated by and believing in the “shortcuts” may blame themselves and their perceived lack of effort in practicing the solutions when their financial state does not change.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">It’s not easy to say that books that call for healing are always proper either. They also risk making people settle where they are rather than improving themselves. People may feel encouraged to avoid problems rather than persevere to reach healthy growth. In other words, while it’s good to comfort the mind, we need to recognize the limitation that the message may not be pragmatic as long as we live in the real world. Strictly speaking, this would not “help” anyone improve themselves, despite the name “self-help books.”</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>A Reflection of Society</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">In this way, this article acknowledges the presence of books as a reflection of society and looks into the popular self-improvement culture in Korea through an analysis of the self-help book market. By analyzing the self-help book market, we gain a window into Korean people’s psyche. These books reveal a nation grappling with the fast pace and pressure of modern life, longing for a better, happier existence. By providing simple solutions and actionable steps, self-help books can empower individuals and give them a sense of control over their lives. Explaining the two categories of self-help books and mentioning their potential risks is not to blame or criticize them—many people might consider them a valuable resource for personal growth.</span></p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Nevertheless, it’s crucial to approach self-help books with a balanced perspective and to recognize the potential flaws of such simplified advice. We should approach them with caution, remembering that they reflect a society deeply affected by competition and dissatisfaction. The key to happiness isn’t contained in a single self-help book. What we need is a broader discussion about the social structures making life so difficult in the first place. We must address the systemic factors that contribute to individual struggles and discuss the solutions together.</span></p>
