<p>Student-athletes are often driven by a combination of personal passion, external influences, and a desire to challenge themselves. The balance between sports and academics demands both resilience and sacrifices as they navigate societal expectations and personal aspirations. For Lim Se-Eun, television played a major influence in her decision to become an athlete. Initially, she was drawn by professional rhythmic gymnasts’ beautiful clothes and &nbsp;movements. However, ultimately, it wasn’t just about the glamor—it was the joy and thrill of the sport that motivated her. She explained, “At that time I was doing it for fun, and my friend who was learning with me wanted to be a professional athlete, so I decided to become one too. I was so attracted to sports [for the above reasons], that’s why I decided to become an athlete.” Thanks to her parents' support, Lim was able to transfer to a school with a rhythmic gymnastics team, allowing her to focus on her training. Her parent’s investment and encouragement fueled her drive to succeed, but they also added pressure. She didn’t want all of her parents' efforts to be in vain, she admitted, pushing herself to practice harder and achieve better results.</p><p>“It was my decision, so I just thought I had to overcome the difficulties.” Lim said, reflecting on her journey. Despite practicing six days a week for long hours, she never lost sight of her goal. “I believe that at the end of the day I will achieve my dream and all of this work will be worth it,” Her resilience enabled her to overcome moments of doubt and fatigue.</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:922/918;" src="https://snuquill-public-s3.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/photo/article/862d74b8-e27c-4790-be6c-2a8cb54c26dc.jpg" width="922" height="918"></figure><p>While Lim’s story is one of triumph in sports, other student-athletes take a different route, focusing on academics as a more secure path. Lee Gisoo is one such example. He started rugby at age 15, but quickly realized that his chances of becoming a professional athlete were slim. “I did my best in every situation, but I was very fast to recognize I wasn’t that talented to become a professional athlete,” he admitted. Instead, he decided to prioritize academics while continuing to train, hoping to enter Seoul National University (SNU), as he desired to attend a renowned university. Rugby would only provide an edge over other applicants if he got accepted into a national team; this would not be the case for him, thus leading him to focus on his academics over his passion.</p><p>Lee’s initial motivation for playing rugby came from his grandfather, a former track athlete. “My grandfather asked me to play rugby, because he graduated from the same middle school as me.” Lee explains. His grandfather incentivized him to be an athlete to share the good experiences he lived, and hoped that it would be beneficial for his grandson. Although he never aimed to become an elite athlete, Lee remained dedicated to rugby out of respect for his grandfather, who supported him financially. Balancing rugby with his demanding studies required immense discipline. His daily schedule was packed: school from 8 a.m., rugby practice starting at 2 p.m. until 10 p.m., and then studying late into the night, only to go to bed at 2 a.m. When asked why he pushed himself so hard, Lee responded confidently, “I should do something more than others, that’s why I chose to study. Sacrifices were very necessary to achieve good academic results. So I tried my best to maintain the balance between sports and academics.”</p><figure class="image"><img style="aspect-ratio:918/920;" src="https://snuquill-public-s3.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/photo/article/e8ae7335-a593-4f65-8b0d-4e1d9f269049.jpg" width="918" height="920"></figure><p>The motivations driving athletes to pursue careers in sports are as diverse as the athletes themselves. For some, like Lim, it’s a burning passion for the sport. For others, like Lee, it’s about balancing the love for the game with the practical need to secure a stable future. Both athletes highlight the importance of external influences on the journeys, whether it be familial support or societal expectations. Their families provide a foundation for their growth, but societal expectations and pressures to excel in studies or sports create additional challenges.</p><p>Despite their motivation to pursue their athletic careers and the support they received, both Lim and Lee eventually shifted their focus to more sustainable career paths. This is attributed to the lacking social support system in Korea, which will be explored further in the last article of this series, delving deeper into the sports industry by comparing the support structures for student-athletes in the U.S. and South Korea and examining how these systems shape the paths of young athletes, and their opportunities for success.</p>
