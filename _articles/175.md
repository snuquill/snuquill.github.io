<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Seoul National University students welcomed their 64th student council president in December 2024. On November 4th, 2024, the Seoul National University Election Committee hosted a debate between the two competing candidates for the honorable position. The debate handled multiple issues relevant to the daily and academic life of SNU students, including the increase of tuition fees, student welfare, and improvement of the academic system. It was an opportunity to compare and contrast the visions of the two candidates,&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> and&nbsp;<i>Signal.</i>&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> sees the student council’s role as a “center for problem-solving,” viewing continuous communication and reflecting voices from the students as the core role of the student council.&nbsp;<i>Signal</i> aims to create a sustainable student council structure that can last beyond their time in office through cooperation with SNU colleges.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">My personal thoughts as I was watching the debate: “Whoever wins the election, the SNU student council seriously needs to grow a backbone.” Why? Both candidates seem to fear controversy more than the actual problems that plague SNU students’ school life. In response to one of the debate questions about how they would conduct when a conflict of interest between the school administration and the students arises,&nbsp;<i>Haru&nbsp;</i>flat out stated that they would compromise because the administration controls the funds for essential campus welfare and cultural events.&nbsp;<i>Signal&nbsp;</i>also expressed reluctance to take a strong stance against the administration, although they did vaguely mention that they would take action if the administration refuses to listen to the students. Some might say&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> and&nbsp;<i>Signal</i> are being pragmatic, but sometimes, “pragmatic” is an euphemism for “meek.”&nbsp;<i>Signal</i> went on to win the election, but their victory did not diminish the concerns raised by their debate performance.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Another important issue was the protection of minority rights.&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> argued that direct communication and preemptive problem-solving through opinion gathering are crucial in protecting minority rights.&nbsp;<i>Signal</i> proposed that the council serve as a platform for protecting minority rights, suggesting activities like human rights card news production and barrier-free procedures. While both candidates did not make any explicitly offensive statements, their choice not to mention any other minority groups other than the disabled and vegans was just as bad. Were they really naive enough to believe that the two are the only minority groups on campus? Or were they wary of the backlash they might receive if they advocated for “controversial” rights of women and queer students?&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The candidates’ hesitance to challenge the administration and their reluctance to support minority rights explicitly stem from the same root: a fear of controversy that undermines the council’s principal purpose. A student council’s core mission is to represent and protect the diverse interests of all students, which inherently requires taking principled stands. However, a student council that cannot stand up to administration pressure is unlikely to champion controversial minority rights issues. Conversely, a council that shies away from protecting minority students signals to the administration that it will likely back down on other contentious issues as well.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>The Lost Spirit of Student Advocacy</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">In the 1960s, Seoul National University’s student council stood as a beacon of democracy during South Korea’s darkest hours. The student council orchestrated demonstrations that would become pivotal moments in Korea’s fight for democracy, proving that student leadership could shape a nation. This legacy makes the current state of SNU’s student council all the more painful to witness. Where fierce advocates of justice once stood, we now find an organization that prides itself on being “apolitical.” The previous council,&nbsp;<i>Noon</i>’s declaration of maintaining an apolitical stance on any issue charged with the dispute isn’t just a departure from tradition; it’s an abdication of responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">This transformation from fearless advocate to cautious administrator represents more than just a change in leadership style. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the council’s role. The student council wasn’t established to be a junior partner to the school administration but to be the organized voice of student power and rights. The irony is that this “safe” approach ultimately makes the council less effective even in its chosen role as administrator. Without demonstrating a willingness to actively defend student rights and challenge unfair policies, the council loses the moral authority needed to effectively represent students’ interests. Each compromise, each silent assent, further erodes the council’s legitimacy and influence.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">A student council is not meant to be an extension of the university administration but rather a counterbalance to it, representing student interests even when—especially when—they conflict with administrative priorities. The council has adopted what it calls a “pragmatic approach,” which in practice means avoiding friction at all costs. This creates a dangerous precedent where the administration knows it can count on council compliance rather than a challenge. This presents a false choice between cooperation and confrontation. Looking at successful student councils globally, we see that effective advocacy often involves both. The most successful councils maintain professional relationships with the administration while unafraid to take strong stands when necessary. They understand that constructive tension is not only acceptable but often necessary for meaningful change.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;"><strong>The Elephant in the Room: Minority Rights</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The current student council’s approach to minority rights reveals a troubling pattern of strategic silence. While they readily engage with general student concerns like cafeteria prices or library hours, they consistently sidestep issues affecting minority students—issues that, though affecting fewer students numerically, often have more profound impacts on their well-being. LGBTQ+ students continue to face significant challenges on campus, from the absence of anti-discrimination policies to the lack of safe spaces where their identities can be acknowledged. Similarly, students with disabilities face persistent accessibility issues. Basic accommodations like ramp access and elevator maintenance remain inadequate in several buildings.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The University Principle of SNU currently does not specify the right not to be discriminated against on gender, nationality, race, disability, region, age, and religion because the University-wide Student Representative Council failed time and again to reach an agreement. There were various concerns regarding the implementation of such a right, including one raised by&nbsp;<i>Haru</i>’s candidate, Lee Kang-Jun. His concern was that there was not enough discussion about the change in the student council system as a whole to make the amendment. It is disappointing to see that&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> has merely reiterated the importance of “ample discussion” regarding the subject while failing even to mention it in their policy brochure.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The council’s reluctance stems from a misguided political calculus: the fear that addressing “controversial” issues might alienate the majority or antagonize the administration. This is a legitimate fear shared not only among council members but also among some students. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands the council’s mandate. A student council’s legitimacy comes not from representing the majority’s comfort but from protecting the rights of all students, especially those most vulnerable to marginalization. More importantly, we cannot let fear dictate the life we experience as SNU students.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The council must embrace the understanding that true leadership often requires taking unpopular stands and facing administration pushback. By implementing these measures while maintaining professionalism, the council can transform into an effective advocate for all students while preserving necessary working relationships with the administration. Success will require courage, persistence, and support from the broader student body. The council must communicate clearly that these changes are essential for creating a more equitable and responsive university environment. By taking these steps, SNU’s student council can begin to rebuild its reputation as a fearless advocate for student rights and interests.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">The SNU student council stands at a critical crossroads. The choice it faces is not merely about succession or administrative efficiency. It’s about the integral purpose of student representation in university governance. The current pattern of diplomatic silence and administrative focus has created a council that excels at organizing events but falters in its core mission of student advocacy. The recent debate between the&nbsp;<i>Haru</i> and&nbsp;<i>Signal</i> campaigns highlighted the tension between administrative efficiency and advocacy. While both campaigns emphasized communication and systematic approaches, neither fully addressed the council’s retreat from its historical role as a bold defender of student rights.&nbsp;<i>Signal</i>’s subsequent election victory makes it all the more crucial that these concerns be addressed as they take office.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">To current and future council members, the message is clear: your role extends beyond managing student services. You are the voice of students who often cannot speak for themselves, the defender of rights that might otherwise be forgotten, and the conscience of an institution that sometimes forgets its educational mission in pursuit of other goals. The question facing the council is not whether it can survive another election cycle, but whether it can reclaim its role as a fearless advocate for student rights and interests. The answer to this question will determine not just the council’s future but also the character of student life at SNU for years to come.</span></p>
