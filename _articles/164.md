<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">I was a bit late to jump on the Netflix trend. When I finally did, I found it odd that many of the globally popular Netflix series leaned toward bizarre, dark, and thrilling genres: such examples include<i> Orange is the New Black, Money Heist, Stranger Things,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Squid Game</i>. It struck me as unusual that calm and soothing works were rarely at the top of the recommendation lists. Instead, highly stimulating and dark shows consistently rank among the most popular series. Through these popular titles, I caught a glimpse of the dopamine-driven tendencies embedded in the mainstream taste.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Indeed, over the past decade, there has been a staggering increase in the demand for dopamine, referring to a desire for instant gratification and short-term stimulation in Korean society. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that signals pleasure to the brain and plays a crucial role in motivation, reward, and enjoyment. When engaging in enjoyable activities such as watching interesting media, gaming, or eating, dopamine is released from the brain’s ventral tegmental area, reinforcing reward-seeking behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Social media platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok intensify such dopamine culture in Korea. Users passively scroll through short videos to experience rapid bursts of pleasure. In fact, the average daily views of YouTube Shorts in Korea as of July 2023 increased by over 90% compared to the same month the previous year. During the same period, the number of daily viewers logged into YouTube Shorts in Korea also rose by more than 40% year-on-year, according to YouTube.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Short-deu—a combination of the words “short” and “drama”—are a genre of drama recaps edited to showcase the highlights of each episode and provide a quick summary, and exemplify such a trend in Korea. This trend contributed to the rise of “brain rot”: a condition of mental fogginess, lethargy, low attention span, and an overall cognitive decline that results from excessive screen engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Not only does the dopamine trend shorten people’s attention spans, but it also amplifies the intensity of the content people consume, leading to emotional fatigue and desensitization. A striking example is the recent Korean Netflix drama&nbsp;<i>The 8 Show,</i> which has faced criticism for its extreme violence and overstimulation. Ironically, the show critiques modern society’s addiction to dopamine-driven entertainment. Initially hailed as the next&nbsp;<i>Squid Game</i>,&nbsp;<i>The 8 Show</i> quickly drew backlash for its excessive scenes of brutality, including depictions of punishment, torture, and bodily harm, leaving many viewers feeling overwhelmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Drama critic Oh Soo-Kyung has observed a growing fatigue among audiences, with one viewer commenting, “I don’t understand the need to show such long scenes of violence and torture.” Oh further remarked, “Netflix’s violent content seems to have peaked with&nbsp;<i>The 8 Show</i>. It’s time to question whether gaining attention via excessive sensationalism is ethically justified.” This reflects a larger cultural reckoning with the ethical limits of entertainment in an age of dopamine saturation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">One of the primary reasons why Korean society is seeking more and more dopamine lies in a lack of disposable time. Disposable time, which are moments reserved for personal enjoyment and self-care after fulfilling work and family obligations, is alarmingly scarce in Korean society. Overwhelmed by long working hours, grueling commutes, and senseless urban competition, many Koreans turn to instant gratification as a coping mechanism, much like using painkillers to mask an underlying issue without addressing its root cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">This issue is further compounded by a cultural expectation to actively participate in family events and company gatherings(<i>hoesik</i>) which, while rooted in fostering connection, often adds to the stress of an already busy schedule. These obligations demand significant time and energy, leaving individuals with even fewer opportunities to focus on themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">In turn, people are numbing themselves with quick fixes not only through highly stimulating shows, but also trendy, sugary desserts. Food trends such as&nbsp;<i>croffles, tanghulu, Yonsei cream buns, Yoajung</i>(Yogurt Ice Cream), and&nbsp;<i>Fix Chocolate</i> have surged and vanished rapidly in Korea, offering fleeting bursts of sweetness that perfectly embody Korea’s dopamine-driven consumption habits. These trends are amplified by social media platforms, where viral mukbangs and trendy food posts make indulgence both aspirational and accessible. COVID-19 further cemented this culture, with the rise of delivery services allowing for instant access to popular desserts and snacks.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">This phenomenon has certainly been enabled by Korea’s high Internet and smartphone penetration rate and fast-paced lifestyle. However, the fundamental reason lies in the lack of “headspace” to pause and reflect. This pervasive quick-fix mentality perpetuates the problem, leaving people further disconnected from practices that truly promote long-term well-being and happiness.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Dopamine, while often seen in a negative light, is a two-sided concept. The chemical itself is not harmful; rather, it is the pursuit of effortless pleasure that leads to addiction. Activities like exercise and cooking release dopamine in ways that support mental and emotional well-being. As awareness of dopamine’s effects grows, the idea of a “dopamine detox” has gained attention in Korean society. Practices like the “screen time challenge”, which encourages people to limit their smartphone and short-form content consumption, are becoming increasingly popular. Businesses are also tapping into this trend: a book café in Gangnam, Seoul, has banned cell phones and laptops, offering visitors a chance to experience "healing through digital detox."</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Awareness of dopamine addiction serves as a catalyst for confronting the structures that trap individuals in cycles of dependency. This growing recognition sheds light on previously overlooked aspects of overstimulation, emphasizing that balance, self-control, and even discomfort are essential for a meaningful life. By confronting the concept of "dopamine addiction," people are learning the importance of moderation, inspiring self-reflection, and fostering healthier habits.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">One of the most troubling aspects of dopamine culture is its impact on human connection. The pervasive use of SNS has weakened social bonds, reducing interactions to superficial or transactional exchanges. Many online interactions prioritize instant gratification—likes, comments, and quick responses—over deeper connections. In response, a counter-trend is emerging: a growing number of people are actively seeking offline, genuine conversations to fulfill their innate desire for connection and belonging.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;">Ultimately, healthy and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to happiness. Addressing the root problems of dopamine culture requires a societal shift that values patience, focus, and authenticity over instant gratification. Each individual can contribute to this change by reflecting on their habits and making conscious efforts to foster deeper connections with people to engage in long-term and meaningful pursuits.&nbsp;</span></p>
